This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## About The Project

![Calculate the footprint of your flight travel!](./public/images/footprint.png)

This is my last project for s2i platform. Here I've used Nextjs framework creating a small app for calculating the footprint of a travel by plane.
It is possible so looking for arrival and departure city/country/airport and choosing the number of passengers.
You will see the result for passenger and for the total of passengers from [Climatiq Api](https://www.climatiq.io/). 
It is possible to submit name surname and e mail to the form and it will be saved in MONGODB.


## Using Footprint App

To use the Footprint App, follow these steps:

```
press inside the search bar
start typing the name of airport or country of departure
start typing the name of airport or country of arrival
chose the number of passengers
press GO button
```
You can find the app deployed on github pages at the address https://footprint-project.vercel.app/.
